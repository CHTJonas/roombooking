<p>
  The ADC Room Booking System doesn't use usernames and passwords â€” instead you will need to login with your <%= link_to 'Camdram', 'https://www.camdram.net' %> account in order to make bookings.
  This will then allow you to book rehearsal spaces on behalf of shows and societies that you manage.
  If you need to make a booking for something other than a meeting or rehearsal, or are otherwise not authorised to make bookings, please speak to a member of ADC Management.
