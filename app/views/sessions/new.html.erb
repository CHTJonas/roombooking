<p>
  The ADC Room Booking System doesn't use usernames and passwords â€” instead you need to login with your <%= link_to 'Camdram', 'https://www.camdram.net' %> account.
  This will allow you to book rooms and other spaces on behalf of shows and societies that you have admin rights to on Camdram.
  If you need to make a booking for something other than a meeting, audition or rehearsal, or are otherwise unable to make bookings, please speak to a member of ADC Management.
</p>

<p>
  When you login, your name and email address will be copied across from Camdram to the Room Booking System.
  The connection with Camdram will also be used to obtain an up-to-date list of shows and societies that you administer.
  By continuing, you acknowledge that you are happy for this to happen.
  For more details please see Room Booking's <%= link_to 'Privacy Policy', page_path('privacy') %>.
